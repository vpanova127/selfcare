              The Story Behind  

            </div>
            <div class="about-text-top">
                On his wounded fifth album, Mac Miller sings deftly about heartbreak and his mental state, capturing his resignation without turning sadness into a performative spectacle.

            <div class="about-text-bottom">
                “Self Care”, one of the songs off Miller’s last album “Swimming” released in August, and consists of Miller singing about his emotions, particularly in regards to emotions about himself and others. The song consists of lyrics such as “I switched the time zone, but what do I know?”, as well as “Can’t trust no one, can’t even trust yourself, yeah”, which illustrates Miller’s rollercoaster of feelings of not only towards himself but others too. There’s also been talk around the lyrics “And I love you, I don’t love nobody else, yeah”, and to them alluding to his ex Ariana Grande. There’s also been speculation that the song is about his ex and about Miller coming to terms with loving himself without anyone else. Three minutes and twenty seconds into the song, the beat changes from hip hop to a smooth R’n’B vibe, echoing Miller’s more melancholic lyrics such as “we spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high”, and “we play it cool, we know we f**ked though”, being sincerely honest about his addiction in a very simple way.
